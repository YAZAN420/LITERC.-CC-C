# **Car Control (Gyro & Self-Driving)** üî•


## Introduction üöÄ
This project creates a smart car controlled either by X and Y values from an MPU6050 gyroscope, or self-driving.
1. The gyroscope is connected to an Arduino Uno, which sends the data to a laptop for processing. The laptop forwards the data to an ESP8266 via Wi-Fi, and the ESP8266 controls the car's DC motors through an L298N motor driver. This project explores wireless communication, IoT, and real-time motor control.
2. self-driving and avoiding obstacles using Ultrasonic.

## System Architecture and Algorithm üß†

### mode 1 : using gyro
### 1. MPU6050 ‚Üí Arduino
- The MPU6050 gyroscope is connected to the Arduino Uno via I2C. The Arduino reads gyro values (X and Y axes) and transmits them to the laptop via a serial interface using the cvzone library.

### 2. Arduino ‚Üí Laptop
- The laptop reads the gyro values from the Arduino using cvzone. These values are processed, scaled, and adjusted for calibration.

### 3. Laptop ‚Üí ESP8266
- The laptop sends the processed data to the ESP8266 using an HTTP POST request over Wi-Fi. The ESP8266 receives the data and sends commands to the L298N motor driver to control the car's movement.

### 4. ESP8266 ‚Üí Motor Driver
- The L298N motor driver controls the DC motors based on the orientation data received from the ESP8266 and the speed will changed according to its values.

### mode 2 : using ultrasonic

- the ulttasonic sensor reads the distance and controls the motors according to it.

## How it Works  ‚ÅâÔ∏è

### Hardware Setup
- Connect the MPU6050 to the Arduino Uno via I2C.
- Connect the ESP8266 to the Arduino.
- Connect the L298N motor driver to the DC motors and ESP8266 pins.

### Software Setup
- Install the required libraries in the Arduino IDE.

### Usage

- Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino Uno.
- Run the Python code to process the gyro data and send it to the ESP8266.
- choose the mode.
- mode 1 : Control the car's movement by tilting the sensor or using a smartphone gyroscope.
- mode 2 : the car will drive by itself.
